; Normalized linear RGB (red, green, blue) values within range [0..1] for each component
(defconstant +Quantity_TOC_RGB+ 0)

; Normalized non-linear gamma-shifted RGB (red, green, blue) values within range [0..1] for each component
(defconstant +Quantity_TOC_sRGB+ 1)

; Hue + light + saturation components, where:
; - First component is the Hue (H) angle in degrees within range [0.0; 360.0], 0.0 being Red;
;   value -1.0 is a special value reserved for grayscale color (S should be 0.0).
; - Second component is the Lightness (L) within range [0.0; 1.0]
; - Third component is the Saturation (S) within range [0.0; 1.0]

; CIE L*a*b* color space, constructed to be perceptually uniform for human eye.
; The values are assumed to be with respect to D65 2&deg; white point. 
;
; The color is defined by:
; - L: lightness in range [0, 100] (from black to white)
; - a: green-to-red axis, approximately in range [-90, 100]
; - b: blue-to-yellow axis, approximately in range [-110, 95]
;
; Note that not all combinations of L, a, and b values represent visible
; colors, and RGB cube takes only part of visible color space.
;
; When Lab color is converted to RGB, a and b components may be reduced
; (with the same proportion) to fit the result into the RGB range.
(defconstant +Quantity_TOC_CIELab+ 3)

; CIE L*c*h* color space, same as L*a*b* in cylindrical coordinates:
; - L: lightness in range [0, 100] (from black to white)
; - c: chroma, approximately in range [0, 135], 0 corresponds to greyscale
; - h: hue angle, in range [0., 360.]
;
; The hue values of standard colors are approximately:
; - red at 40, 
; - yellow at 103,
; - green at 136,
; - cyan at 196,
; - blue at 306,
; - magenta at 328.
;
; When Lch color is converted to RGB, chroma component may be reduced
; to fit the color into the RGB range.
